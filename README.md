# FinViz-Scraper-Aggregator

You're going to need to have the FinViz screen scraper already installed: https://pypi.org/project/finviz/

Don't use pip install for finviz. That way is broken. 

You need to pip install the git version here:
pip install -U git+https://github.com/mariostoev/finviz

This basically takes the you pull and also calculates 1 year vol. For that you will also need to pip install yfinance.
